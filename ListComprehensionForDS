''' List comprehensions
List comprehension is a concise and efficient way to create lists in Python. It allows you to generate lists in a single line of code, making your code more readable and Pythonic.

1. Basic Syntax
[expression for item in iterable]

expression → The operation to perform on each item
item → The variable representing each element in the iterable
iterable → The data structure being iterated over (list, range, etc.)'''

#Creating List of squares
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
#Filtering even numbers
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

#Replacing even numbers with "Even" and odd numbers with "Odd"
numbers = ["Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd" for x in range(5)]
print(numbers)  # Output: ['Even', 'Odd', 'Even', 'Odd', 'Even']

#Creating pairs from two lists  
pairs = [(x, y) for x in range(2) for y in range(3)]
print(pairs)  # Output: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)]

#Converting a list of strings to uppercase
words = ["hello", "world", "python"]
upper_words = [word.upper() for word in words]
print(upper_words)  # Output: ['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'PYTHON']

#List Comprehension with Set and Dictionary Comprehensions
#Set Comprehension
unique_numbers = {x for x in [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]}
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}

#Dictionary Comprehension
squared_dict = {x: x**2 for x in range(5)}
print(squared_dict)  # Output: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}

'''8. When to Use List Comprehensions?
You need to create a list in a single line
The logic is simple and readable
You want to improve performance (faster than loops)
Avoid when:

The logic is too complex (use a standard loop instead for clarity)'''

# Performance Comparison: List Comprehension vs. Loop

import time

# Using a for loop
start = time.time()
squares_loop = []
for x in range(10**6):
    squares_loop.append(x**2)
print("Loop time:", time.time() - start)

# Using list comprehension
start = time.time()
squares_comp = [x**2 for x in range(10**6)]
print("List Comprehension time:", time.time() - start)

#List comprehensions are generally faster than loops because they are optimized internally by Python.

'''Summary
Concept	Example
Basic List Comprehension	[x**2 for x in range(5)]
With Condition (if)	[x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
With if-else	["Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd" for x in range(5)]
Nested Loop	[(x, y) for x in range(2) for y in range(3)]
Flatten 2D List	[num for row in matrix for num in row]
Set Comprehension	{x for x in [1, 2, 2, 3]}
Dictionary Comprehension	{x: x**2 for x in range(5)} '''
